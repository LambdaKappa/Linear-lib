# Description #

Linear Algebra library inspired by Python's 'Numpy' library. I am planning to restucture it completely in the following week.

# Examples of use #

You can include header of the library into your code file like this:
```C++
#include "Linear.hpp"
```

# Create a new Array #

Library's "Matrix" class supports a variety of data types.

```C++
ln::Matrix<int> Matrix = {{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}}; 
```
